# ideaGEN: The Invention Engine

**Because coming up with good ideas is hard.**

Let’s be honest: the hardest part of a hackathon isn't the coding—it's figuring out what to build that isn't another to-do list or a weather app. We built **ideaGEN** because we were tired of staring at a blank whiteboard.

### What is it?
It’s an AI that finds problems you didn't even know you had. While other tools help you code, ideaGEN tells you *what* to code. It digs through messy feedback and "normal human complaining" to find actual billion-dollar product ideas.

### How it works (The Simple Version)
1. **The Rant**: You feed it raw transcripts, support tickets, or just a list of things that annoy you.
2. **The Brain**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet does the heavy lifting, finding the "hidden friction" in your data.
3. **The Magic**: It spits out a full PRD and a live UI mock. 

### The Tech Stack
* **Brain**: Claude 3.5 (The smart one)
* **Storage**: Supabase (The reliable one)
* **Frontend**: Next.js (The fast one)
* **Vibe**: 100% Innovation. 0% To-Do Lists.
